            For travel to the venue for ceremony guests, a coach will be
            organised nearer the time for those located in and around Norwich.{" "}

            For those making their own way, we'd recommend either driving or
            getting a taxi (sorry it's a trek ðŸ˜…). There is parking at the
            venue, and you're able to leave your car overnight if you wish.
