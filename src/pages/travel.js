          <p>
            To get to the venue we'd recommend either driving or getting a taxi
            as the public transport links aren't great (sorry it's a trek ðŸ˜…).
            There is parking at the venue and you're able to leave your car
            overnight if you wish.
          </p>
          <p>
            For travelling home, please ensure you've prebooked a taxi to your
            destination. If you are coming with a small party and would liek to
            share a taxi with someone to save money please contact us and we
            will try to pair you with someone going the same direction (this is
            only viable on our end if you plan to stay until the end, sorry!)

            {" "}
            We'd recommend those travelling for the event to stay in Norwich if
            you're not driving, as accomodation near the venue is hard to find
            and fairly remote. There are lots of reasonably priced Airbnbs in
            Norwich, and it's a nice place to visit for the weekend. If anyone
            unfamiliar with the area wants any recommendations or advice please
            reach out to one of us.
